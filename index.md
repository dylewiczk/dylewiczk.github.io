# Welcome to my CFD portfolio

I am a PhD level CFD engineer with expertise in external aerodynamics with experience in laminar-turbulent transition in supersonic, and hypersonic, flows.

I finished my masters degree in aerospace engineering in 2021 at the University of Liverpool. The same year, I have started my PhD journey that I have recently completed with thesis titled "Linear Instabilities in Hypersonic Conical Flows - Stability Analysis and Advancements in Numerical Methods".

I work using opensource software like OpenFOAM, SU2 or Gmsh.

## Skills & Tools

- **CFD Software:** OpenFOAM, SU2
- **Programming:** Python, MATLAB, Fortran
- **Visualization:** ParaView
- **Other:** Mesh generation (Gmsh, snappyHexMesh), HPC simulation setups
