# Welcome to My CFD Portfolio

I am a PhD level CFD engineer with expertise in external aerodynamics with experience in laminar-turbulent transition in supersonic, and hypersonic, flows.

I finished my masters degree in aerospace engineering in 2021 at the University of Liverpool. The same year, I have started my PhD journey that I have recently completed with thesis titled "Linear Instabilities in Hypersonic Conical Flows - Stability Analysis and Advancements in Numerical Methods".

I work using opensource software like OpenFOAM, SU2 or Gmsh.
